Snakes - By Rosh Mendis
=======================

A fun snake game where you eat the food to make your tail grow. At the time of which I made it, I hadn't seen many snake games around, so I decided to make my own. 

Features
--------
On top of the normal one player game where you collect food to build up your tail and increase your points, I have done a two player snake game, where you are competing with the other snake for food. You try to make your tail as long as possible so you can use it to block and trap the other snake, and make it crash into you. You start with 5 lives, and whoever is left standing wins. You can either play against a computer opponent or a friend. There is also an option which allows you to go through the walls, which adds to the fun of the game.

Controls
--------
The blue player uses the arrow keys
The red player uses 	w for up
			s for down
			a for left
			d for right
Which is kind of like the arrow keys

Game Library
------------
The game comes with a game library I made myself. It contains a set of functions that should make game programming for you a lot easier - especially when implementing collision detection and artifical intelligence in your own games. Feel free to use it for your games.

The Snakes
----------
To store the data of the snakes I used linked lists. This is an invaluable data structure which allows you to add and delete data dynamically.

Opponents
---------
To program the artifical intelligence for the computer snake I used the Direction function from my game library to make the snake move towards the food. I also added a few things to make it try and dodge the player's tail as well as its own.

Improvements
------------
The game is pretty much done and I haven't encountered any bugs yet. You could probably improve the artifical intelligence for when the level is set to hard and maybe implement some new ideas like allowing the snakes to shoot each other.
